#Go Fighter

###About
This HTML5 canvas game was built entirely from scratch, utilizing TypeScript as the programming language and bypassing the use of any pre-existing game engine. Designed to function as a responsive React component, it offers effortless integration into any React-based project by simply exporting the Game component and its dependencies. The gameplay draws inspiration from the classic game, Street Fighter, delivering similar mechanics and experiences.
